<code>com.abyssaldev.rowi</code>

A Kotlin framework for building platform-independent command responders.  
Automatic module discovery, parameter/type reading, and heavy customization.  
The brains behind the [Abyss](https://github.com/abyssal/abyss) Discord bot.   
Adapted from internal utilities code at GalEdu.  
Named after the [Okarito kiwi.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okarito_kiwi)

## Feature highlights
- Automatic command discovery through Kotlin annotations
- Quick development cycle & less boilerplate with function commands
- Custom pre-execution checks with `ArgumentContract`/`CommandContract`
- Overridable command executables with `CommandExecutable<*>`
- Customisable command discovery strategies
- Automatic type and argument parsing
  - User can add their own custom type parsers
- Discord support with `rowi-jda` (for [JDA](https://github.com/dv8fromtheworld/jda)) or `rowi-catnip` (for [catnip](https://github.com/mewna/catnip))

## How do Rowi commands work?
> **These examples will use Kotlin 1.4.22.**  
  
I'm glad you asked! Let's go over a basic Rowi command, using the default `Command` annotation.  
Firstly, all commands are defined in a class that inherits from `CommandModule` (or a derivative).  
```kt
class MyCommandModule : CommandModule()
```  
Next, we define a command using `Command` and a function:
```kt
@Command(name = "add", description = "Adds two numbers.")
fun addNumbersCommand(request: CommandRequest, first: Int, second: Int)
```
> **Did you see how the parameters work?**  
> In Rowi, parameters are automatically parsed from the input string and mapped to the function's expected parameters.
> You can add your own type parsers using `TypeParser<T>`, or install a Rowi integration to add pre-built ones.  
>   
> The `request` object contains some data about the command call, and is a required parameter.
  
Now we'll make our command actually do something:
```kt
println("$first + $second = ${first+second}")
```
  
And then, during initialization, add our module to our Rowi builder:
```kt
commandEngineBuilder.addModules(MyCommandModule())
```

And that's it! Rowi will automatically index your module and register any valid commands, using the inbuilt `Command` strategy.  
> You can add your own strategies, or use strategies available from integrations.


## A quick tour through Rowi integrations
### Core
[`rowi-core`](https://github.com/abyssal/rowi/tree/main/rowi-core) contains all the library code necessary to make a command responder (shell terminal, chatbot, or utility program) - including type parsers for Java & Kotlin primitives (`Int`, `Long`, `Boolean`, etc), some basic command & argument contracts, and a default command discovery strategy that looks for functions with the `Command` annotation.  
  
### Discord
[`rowi-jda`](https://github.com/abyssal/rowi/tree/main/rowi-jda) contains some helpful bindings for the [JDA](https://github.com/dv8fromtheworld/jda) Discord library, including type parsers for Discord objects (`Member`, `Role`, `User`, etc), and command & argument contracts that reflect on Discord entity components. All `rowi-jda` contracts and type parsers depend on your custom request type inherting from `JdaCommandResponse`, which contains contextual data like the author of the message, the channel, the guild, and so on.  
  
 
ðŸš§ [`rowi-catnip`](https://github.com/abyssal/rowi/tree/main/rowi-catnip) aims to achieve the same goals as `rowi-jda`, but mapped to the RxJava-based [catnip](https://github.com/mewna/catnip) Discord library. This library also allows for the automatic discovery and upload of slash-commands/interactions, using the `SlashCommand` annotation.

> **rowi-catnip or rowi-jda?**  
> It's up to you. Both Catnip and JDA are excellent libraries, 
> but as of writing (January 2021), only `rowi-catnip` has support for slash commands, as the JDA developers
> are delaying implementation until around March.  
> [Abyss](https://github.com/abyssal/abyss) (the reference implementation for much of Rowi), utilises `rowi-jda`, but is slowly migrating to `rowi-catnip`.
